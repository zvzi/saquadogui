# saquadogui
```
Hi I made this in 2022 when I used to play Roblox and it was just a gui that
I used as a replacement to other ones and to help other
scripters make stuff for themselves. I don't play Da Hood anymore or a ton of Roblox in general
I also do not script in Roblox anymore. Presumably, this won't be updated ever again since I've moved on from the cheating
in roblox but feel free to use this for whatever purpose. If you want to talk
to me add either of my discord accounts **@lootsu** OR my main **@tkkn** 
Most of the code in this repo does not belong to me and I got some of it sourced from other scripts like Swagmode and scripts like such which were easily found through
the Github repositories of those who made the scripts. Credits to them
Jesus loves you have a great one
